Quickstart: Run a Sod Shock Tube
================================

This tutorial walks you through a complete first run of AthenaK from scratch:
compiling the code, running a simple built-in test problem, and visualizing the
result. The example used here is **Sod's shock tube**, a classic 1D hydrodynamics
test that runs in seconds on a laptop.

If you have not yet obtained the source, see :doc:`download` first (a recursive clone
that includes the Kokkos submodule is required).

Step 1: Compile
---------------

From the top-level repository directory, configure and build a standard CPU
executable:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -B build
   cmake --build build -j

This produces the executable ``build/src/athena``. (For an optimized release build, GPU
builds, and architecture-specific flags, see :doc:`build`.)

Step 2: Look at the input file (optional)
-----------------------------------------

While not strictly necessary to run the code, it is helpful to look at the input file
that defines the problem, ``inputs/hydro/sod.athinput``. A few of the key blocks are:

.. code-block:: text

   <mesh>
   nx1    = 256      # 256 zones...
   x1min  = -0.5     # ...spanning x in [-0.5, 0.5]
   x1max  = 0.5

   <time>
   integrator = rk2   # 2nd-order Runge-Kutta
   cfl_number = 0.8
   tlim       = 0.25  # stop at t = 0.25

   <hydro>
   eos         = ideal
   reconstruct = plm   # piecewise-linear reconstruction
   rsolver     = llf   # local Lax-Friedrichs Riemann solver
   gamma       = 1.4

   <problem>
   dl = 1.0   pl = 1.0    # left state:  density 1.0, pressure 1.0
   dr = 0.125 pr = 0.1    # right state: density 0.125, pressure 0.1

   <output1>
   file_type = tab        # 1D tabular output
   variable  = hydro_w    # primitive variables
   dt        = 0.01       # write every 0.01 in time

See :doc:`input_file` for the full list of blocks and parameters.

Step 3: Run the simulation
--------------------------

Run the executable, pointing it at the input file:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./build/src/athena -i inputs/hydro/sod.athinput

AthenaK prints cycle/time diagnostics to the screen and, by default, writes outputs
into the current directory. The ``tab`` outputs land in a ``tab/`` subdirectory as
``Sod.hydro_w.00000.tab`` through ``Sod.hydro_w.00025.tab`` (26 snapshots, one every
``dt = 0.01`` up to ``tlim = 0.25``), and the history file appears under ``hst/``.

Step 4: Visualize the result
----------------------------

AthenaK ships with lightweight plotting scripts in ``vis/python``. The ``plot_tab.py``
script reads 1D ``.tab`` data and can step through the snapshots as an animation:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 vis/python/plot_tab.py -i tab/Sod.hydro_w.00000.tab -v dens -n 26

Here ``-v dens`` selects the density column and ``-n 26`` reads all 26 frames. The
final frame, at ``t = 0.25``, should look like this:

.. figure:: /_static/sod_quickstart.png
   :alt: Sod shock tube density profile at t = 0.25
   :width: 90%

   Density profile for Sod's shock tube at ``t = 0.25``. From left to right you can
   see the rarefaction fan, the contact discontinuity (near ``x = 0.23``), and the
   shock (near ``x = 0.44``).

See :doc:`analysis` for more tools, including ``plot_slice.py`` for 2D/3D ``.bin``
data and conversion utilities for external visualization software.

Next steps
----------

- Try a multidimensional problem, such as ``inputs/hydro/blast_hydro.athinput`` or
  ``inputs/hydro/kh2d-sin.athinput``, and visualize the ``.bin`` output with
  ``vis/python/plot_slice.py``.
- Override parameters on the command line, e.g. increase the resolution with
  ``mesh/nx1=512`` or change the Riemann solver with ``hydro/rsolver=hllc``.
- Read :doc:`running_the_code` for the full reference on running the code, outputs, and analysis.
