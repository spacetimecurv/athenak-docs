Analysis
========

As discussed in :doc:`outputs`, AthenaK supports multiple output formats. Depending on
the format, there may be multiple ways to analyze the data.

Using AI assistants to make plots
---------------------------------

Modern AI coding assistants (for example those built into editors such as Cursor, or
command-line agents) are often the fastest way to explore and visualize AthenaK output,
and they increasingly make many of the simplest bespoke plotting scripts unnecessary.
Rather than hunting for or maintaining a one-off script, you can describe the figure you
want and let the assistant write and run the plotting code for you.

A few tips that make this work well:

- **Point the assistant at the data readers.** AthenaK ships small, well-documented
  readers in ``vis/python`` (for example ``bin_convert.py`` for ``.bin`` files). Ask the
  assistant to use these so it parses the file format correctly instead of guessing. The
  ASCII ``.hst`` and ``.tab`` files can be read directly with ``numpy``.
- **Be specific about the request.** State the input file, the variable, the slice
  (plane and location for 3D data), the colormap, the normalization (linear/log,
  ``vmin``/``vmax``), and whether you want a single frame or an animation over a sequence
  of dumps.
- **Iterate.** Ask for adjustments ("use a log scale", "overplot the analytic solution",
  "add the AMR block boundaries") the same way you would refine any plot.
- **Verify the physics.** AI-generated code is convenient but not infallible: sanity
  check units, derived quantities, and slice locations against a known case before
  trusting a new figure.

For quantitative or repeatable analysis you may still want a committed script, but for
quick inspection and figure generation an AI assistant working directly against the
output files is usually the shortest path.

Repository analysis tools
-------------------------

The AthenaK repository contains a number of simple scripts for reading data, all inside
the ``vis/python`` directory.

``plot_slice.py``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This script can be used to read a ``.bin`` output, slice it (for 3D data), and plot an
output variable. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 plot_slice.py -d y \      # Slice along the y axis
                         -l 0.0 \    # Slice location
                         --cmap viridis \                     # Matplotlib colormap
                         --norm log --vmin 1e-10 --vmax 1.0 \ # Colorbar normalization
                         --horizon \                          # Plot horizon location
                         gr_torus.mhd_w_bcc.00010.bin \       # input file
                         dens \                               # variable to plot
                         show                                 # show or output filename

This produces an output like the following:

.. image:: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00d40112-cc35-4547-9d52-6963bc86e61d
   :alt: torus
   :width: 684px

Additional arguments can be seen by using the ``-h`` option or reading the instructions
at the beginning of the script.

``plot_tab.py``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This script can be used for quickly looking at tabulated data, including animations.
Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 plot_tab.py -i tab/Sod.mhd_w_bcc.00000.tab \  # input file (stem if -n given)
                       -v dens \                          # variable to plot
                       -n 51                              # number of frames to read

This will generate an animation starting using
``Sod.mhd_w_bcc.[00000..00050].tab`` as inputs. The last frame will look something like
the following:

.. image:: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ac8675c-9d5d-40da-bb7c-7090bad0d427
   :alt: st_rho
   :width: 640px

``plot_hst.py``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TODO

External analysis tools
-----------------------

AthenaK ``.vtk`` outputs can be read by any tool that reads legacy VTK files. ``.hst``
and ``.tab`` files are written as whitespace-separated ASCII files, so they can easily be
read using numpy or similar tools. The ``.bin`` format is a bespoke format, so there are
not currently plugins for major visualization suites. However, there are still some ways
to read these files, either by converting them to a different format or using custom
analysis tools.

Converting to Athena++ XDMF files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``make_athdf.py`` script can be used to convert ``.bin`` files into Athena++
``.athdf`` files, which can be read into visualization software like VisIt or Paraview via
their XDMF readers. In theory this also makes it possible to use many Athena++ tools (see
`the Athena++ wiki <https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena/wiki/Analysis-Tools>`_
for more information), though be aware that AthenaK does have some small differences in
naming conventions that can sometimes lead to incompatibilities.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 make_athdf.py bin/tov.mhd_w_bcc

This will glob all ``*.bin`` files with the stem ``tov.mhd_w_bcc``, such as
``tov.mhd_w_bcc.00000.bin``, ``tov.mhd_w_bcc.00001.bin``, etc., and write out the
corresponding ``.athdf`` and ``.athdf.xmdf`` files.

AthenaK-compatible libraries and tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some users have developed and shared their own analysis tools:

- `plot-tools <https://github.com/jfields7/plot-tools>`_: a collection of scripts
  maintained by Jacob Fields. Many of them are targeted toward numerical relativity
  applications, such as a utility for compact object trackers or the ejecta analysis
  scripts, though the basic file reading and plotting scripts are compatible with any
  dataset.
- `wongutils <https://github.com/gnwong/wongutils>`_: a suite of tools developed by George
  Wong. These tools are excellent for 3D GRMHD data in Kerr-Schild spacetimes, such as
  accretion disks, and they include robust utilities for coordinate transformations,
  swapping between observer-frame and fluid-frame quantities, etc.
