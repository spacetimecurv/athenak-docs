The Mesh and MeshBlocks
=======================

The root grid in every AthenaK simulation is defined on a **uniform Cartesian mesh**: a rectangular domain
divided into equally sized cells. That mesh is in turn partitioned into rectangular
**MeshBlocks**, which are the units of computation, parallel decomposition, and (when enabled)
mesh refinement. Understanding the distinction between the ``<mesh>`` and ``<meshblock>``
blocks is essential, and mixing them up is one of the most common configuration mistakes.

Blocks in the input file are used to specify the parameters of the Mesh and meshBlocks.

- ``<mesh>`` defines the **full simulation domain** and its **total resolution**.
- ``<meshblock>`` defines how that domain is **partitioned into blocks**.

Think of ``<mesh>`` as the global grid and ``<meshblock>`` as the tile size. Each MeshBlock
carries a halo of ghost cells (set by ``<mesh>/nghost``) that is filled from neighboring
blocks or the physical boundary conditions before every update.

The ``<mesh>`` block
--------------------

The ``<mesh>`` block sets the domain extent, resolution, and boundary conditions:

.. code-block:: text

   <mesh>
   nghost = 2            # number of ghost cells per face

   nx1    = 256          # cells along x1
   x1min  = 0.0          # domain limits along x1
   x1max  = 1.0
   ix1_bc = periodic     # inner-x1 boundary
   ox1_bc = periodic     # outer-x1 boundary

   nx2    = 128
   x2min  = 0.0
   x2max  = 0.5
   ix2_bc = reflect
   ox2_bc = reflect

   nx3    = 1            # nx3 = 1 => a 2D calculation
   x3min  = -0.5
   x3max  = 0.5
   ix3_bc = periodic
   ox3_bc = periodic

Key parameters:

- ``nx1``, ``nx2``, ``nx3``: total number of cells along each direction. Setting a direction's
  size to ``1`` makes that direction inactive, so ``nx3 = 1`` gives a 2D run and
  ``nx2 = nx3 = 1`` gives a 1D run.
- ``x1min``/``x1max`` (and the x2, x3 analogues): physical extent of the domain. Cell spacing
  is uniform, e.g. :math:`\Delta x_1 = (x1max - x1min)/nx1`.
- ``nghost`` (default ``2``): number of ghost cells per face. Higher-order reconstruction needs
  more: ``ppm4``/``ppmx`` require ``nghost >= 3`` and ``wenoz`` typically ``nghost >= 4``. With
  SMR/AMR, ``nghost`` must be even.
- ``ix1_bc``/``ox1_bc`` (inner/outer boundary on each face): choose from ``periodic``,
  ``reflect``, ``outflow``, ``inflow``, ``diode``, ``vacuum``, ``shear_periodic`` (shearing
  box only), or ``user`` (defined by the problem generator). If either face of a direction is
  ``periodic``, both faces of that direction must be.

The ``<meshblock>`` block
-------------------------

The ``<meshblock>`` block sets the size of a single MeshBlock:

.. code-block:: text

   <meshblock>
   nx1 = 32
   nx2 = 32
   nx3 = 1

The root mesh is tiled by blocks of this size. Each ``meshblock/nx*`` must **evenly divide**
the corresponding ``mesh/nx*``. If the ``<meshblock>`` block is omitted, each block size
defaults to the full mesh size, i.e. the whole domain is a single MeshBlock.

For the example above (256 x 128 mesh, 32 x 32 blocks) this creates:

- ``256 / 32 = 8`` blocks along x1
- ``128 / 32 = 4`` blocks along x2
- ``1 / 1 = 1`` block along x3

for a total of ``8 * 4 * 1 = 32`` MeshBlocks at the root level.

Why partition into MeshBlocks?
------------------------------

MeshBlocks serve three related purposes:

- **Parallelism.** MeshBlocks are distributed across MPI ranks (and mapped to GPUs/threads via
  Kokkos), so the number and size of blocks controls load balance. As a rule of thumb you want
  at least as many blocks as ranks, and usually several per rank.
- **Refinement.** Static and adaptive mesh refinement operate at the MeshBlock level: a block
  flagged for refinement is replaced by finer child blocks. Block size therefore sets how
  precisely refinement can track a feature.
- **Performance.** Very large blocks reduce ghost-cell overhead but coarsen load balance and
  refinement; very small blocks do the opposite. A few tens of cells per side (e.g. 16–64) is
  a typical sweet spot.

Validation rules to remember
----------------------------

- ``meshblock/nx*`` must evenly divide the corresponding ``mesh/nx*``.
- Active-dimension sizes must be at least 4 cells.
- 2D layouts must be in the ``x1``–``x2`` plane: ``nx2 = 1`` with ``nx3 > 1`` is invalid.
- ``nghost >= 2`` globally, and ``nghost`` must be even when SMR/AMR is used.
- If a direction is periodic, both of its boundaries must be ``periodic``.

Next steps
----------

Many AthenaK simulations use only the uniform Cartesian root grid,
divided into MeshBlocks.  However, once the root mesh and MeshBlock
decomposition are set, you can add refinement on top of it:

- :doc:`smr` — fixed, geometrically-specified refined regions.
- :doc:`amr` — refinement that adapts to the solution at run time.

The initial state on this mesh is set by a :doc:`problem generator <problem_generators>`.
